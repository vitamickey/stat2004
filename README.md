for 2021 sem 2 delivery of stat2004

## why this exist?
me trying to digest all this info and references to assignments or tutorial exercises for students. for full context, please be a stat2004 student with access to UQ blackboard. I reference a couple of things that you need to go and access from previous courses if you wish for full context. 

this has been written for me but if it helps you then that makes me glad. thus, I share :)

pls read the preamble before perusing. 

also I am so glad these notes are extremely applicable for STAT3001
